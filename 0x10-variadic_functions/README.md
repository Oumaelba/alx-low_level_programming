0x10. C - Variadic functions
This repository contains solutions to the variadic functions project of the low-level programming track at ALX.

Description
The C programming language provides the ability to define functions that can take a variable number of arguments of different types. These functions are called variadic functions, and they are implemented using the stdarg.h header file.

In this project, we learn how to create and use variadic functions. We implement a set of functions that can take a variable number of arguments and perform a specific task.
Files
variadic_functions.h: header file containing the prototypes of all the functions in this project.
0-sum_them_all.c: function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
1-print_numbers.c: function that prints all its parameters.
2-print_strings.c: function that prints all its string parameters.
3-print_all.c: function that prints anything.
Usage
To use any of the functions in this project, simply include the variadic_functions.h header file in your C program and call the desired function.
