Singly Linked Lists - Project 0x12
This project is a coding challenge that requires the implementation of a singly linked list data structure and various functions that manipulate it.

Overview
In this project, we will be implementing a singly linked list in C, which is a data structure consisting of nodes linked together in a linear fashion. Each node in the linked list contains a data value and a pointer to the next node in the list. We will be writing various functions that allow us to manipulate the linked list, such as adding, removing, and traversing nodes.
Files
The project repository contains the following files:

lists.h: Header file containing function prototypes and struct definitions
0-print_list.c: Function that prints all the elements of a singly linked list
1-list_len.c: Function that returns the number of elements in a singly linked list
2-add_node.c: Function that adds a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list
3-add_node_end.c: Function that adds a new node at the end of a singly linked list
4-free_list.c: Function that frees a singly linked list
